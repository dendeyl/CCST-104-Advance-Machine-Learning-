**1. Assessment Task 5: Bank Customer**

**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and account information using logistic regression.

**2. Assessment Task: Predicting Feedback on Online Food Orders Using Logistic Regression**

**Objective:** Develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer feedback (positive/negative) on online food orders. This task involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.

**3. Assessment Task: Netflix Userbase Analysis**

**Objective:** Leverage linear regression to predict Monthly Revenue and logistic regression to classify customers based on a positive or negative feedback proxy, using the Netflix Userbase dataset. This task will encompass data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.
Dataset:

**4. Assessment Task: Pollution Data Time Series Analysis Using ARIMA**

**Objective:** The goal of this assessment is to simulate a time series dataset representing a country's annual pollution levels over a decade. You will apply time series analysis techniques, including the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to understand the data's behavior, test for stationarity, and forecast future pollution levels.

**6. Forecasting with Arima Model - MIDTERM**

**Objective:** To apply ARIMA modeling techniques to forecast the number of app updates in the Google Play Store for the next 12 months based on historical data.
