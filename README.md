1. EXER5-LinearRegression
Assessment Task 5: Bank Customer

Objective: Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and account information using logistic regression.

Dataset Overview Imagine we have a dataset named bank_customers.csv with the following columns: Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kidoen/bank-customers-data

2. EXER6-LogisticRegression
Assessment Task: Predicting Feedback on Online Food Orders Using Logistic Regression

Objective: Develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer feedback (positive/negative) on online food orders. This task involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.

Dataset: You will use a dataset that contains information on online food orders, including customer demographics, order details, and feedback. The dataset includes features like Age, Gender, Marital Status, Occupation, Monthly Income, and Feedback.

3. EXER7-Netflix Userbase Analysis
Assessment Task: Netflix Userbase Analysis

Objective:

Leverage linear regression to predict Monthly Revenue and logistic regression to classify customers based on a positive or negative feedback proxy, using the Netflix Userbase dataset. This task will encompass data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.
Dataset:

"Netflix Userbase.csv", containing user demographics, subscription details, and other relevant information.
4. EXER8-Pollution Data Time Series Analysis Using ARIMA
Assessment Task: Pollution Data Time Series Analysis Using ARIMA

Objective:

The goal of this assessment is to simulate a time series dataset representing a country's annual pollution levels over a decade. You will apply time series analysis techniques, including the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to understand the data's behavior, test for stationarity, and forecast future pollution levels.

Dataset Simulation: Simulate a time series dataset for a country's annual pollution levels over 10 years. Assume a trend component, a seasonal component, and some random noise in the data. The dataset "most-polluted-countries.csv" contains several columns related to pollution and country characteristics for the year 2023. Here are some key columns in the dataset:

pollution_2023: Pollution figures for the year 2023.
pollution_growth_Rate: The growth rate of pollution from the previous year.
country_name: Name of the country.
country_region: The region where the country is locat`ed.
united_nation_Member: Whether the country is a member of the United Nations.
country_land_Area_in_Km: The land area of the country in square kilometers.
pollution_density_in_km: Pollution density per square kilometer.
pollution_density_per_Mile: Pollution density per square mile.
share_borders: Countries with which the country shares its borders.
pollution_Rank: The rank of the country based on its pollution.
mostPollutedCountries_particlePollution: Particle pollution levels in the country.
For a time series analysis using the ARIMA model, we typically need a time series data column (e.g., dates or years) and a numerical value column to predict (e.g., pollution figures over time for a specific country)

5. MIDTERMS-Forecasting with Arima Model
Forecasting with Arima Model

Objective: To apply ARIMA modeling techniques to forecast the number of app updates in the Google Play Store for the next 12 months based on historical data.

Dataset: Google Play Store Dataset

Description: Contains information about the google play store.
Use Case: Ideal for time series analysis to predict continuous outcomes like the downloads based on various features (e.g., ratings, reviews, installs).
